## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have updated the description to clearly articulate that this package provides functions to generate frequency tables.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.0
* ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.4.0


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.

---

* I have run R CMD check on downstream dependencies.
